# Spot Finding

The DIALS spot finding has two algorithms which can be used: the basic dispersion spot finding and "dispersion extended" which is not documented anywhere. My intention here is to document both of these including the second, achieved by reverse-engineering the algorithm itself.

N.B. the documentation exlpains _what_ it does with my best understanding of _why_. I do not claim that what it does it correct.
