# Processing with XDS

XDS is a very well established, very quick data processing program. The classic program is used on the command line, though there is also the XDS-GUI. In this tutorial we will run XDS on the command line, then review what was done with the XDS GUI. There is [documentation on the wiki](https://wiki.uni-konstanz.de/xds/index.php/Main_Page) as well as [formal online documentation](https://xds.mr.mpg.de/html_doc/XDS.html). The program reads a file called `XDS.INP` which contains the instructions as to what to do. We will use `generate_XDS.INP`, a script maintained by Kay Diederichs, to generate the input file.

## Too Long Didn't Read

I am too busy and I don't have time for this:

```console
generate_XDS.INP "../insulin_042225_15_1_00????.cbf"
xds_par
```

This will print _a lot_ of stuff to the output and, if something goes wrong, you will need to read that output. If all goes well, you will need to review the output to decide e.g. on the resolution and explore the "ISa" of your data (which is one of the statistics that encapsulates the "quality" of your data).

## Optional: XDS.INP

The `XDS.INP` file contains some very old and shouty instructions on all they key parameters for processing your data: XDS _does not_ read the image headers (contrast this with DIALS).

The critical lines are:

```console
JOB= XYCORR INIT COLSPOT IDXREF DEFPIX INTEGRATE CORRECT
```

which defines, what processing needs to be performed, here geometric corrections, spot finding, integration and correction. The next lines:

```console
ORGX= 2105.73 ORGY= 2193.20
DETECTOR_DISTANCE= 150.00000
OSCILLATION_RANGE= 0.2000
STARTING_ANGLE= 0.0000
X-RAY_WAVELENGTH= 0.97920
```

define the geometry (beam centrw, wavelength, rotation info) then

```console
NAME_TEMPLATE_OF_DATA_FRAMES=/Users/graeme/data/necat-e-2025-04/2025-04-22-ins/15/insulin_042225_15_1_00????.cbf
DATA_RANGE=1 1800
SPOT_RANGE=1 900
```

defines what data to use in all processing (`DATA_RANGE=`) and spot finding (`SPOT_RANGE`). Finally, there is:

```console
INCLUDE_RESOLUTION_RANGE=50 0
```

which defines what data will be included - this is something we will revisit.

## Running

Type `xds_par`, wait. Maybe not very long, if you are on my laptop ðŸ˜‰ because XDS is very fast. You can also run everything through XDSGUI which allows you to run each step one at a time, review the results then proceed - I will demo this in real time.

## Results

Review in XDSGUI... this is the easiest way to look at the graphs in the output, and look at where the spots were found. In many respects the process of running XDS is very similar to DIALS, and we can look to find some very similar information.

### Spot Finding

The spot finding looks for spots in the first half of the data set by default, when running with `generate_XDS.INP`. You should see a fairly constant number of spots across the data set - if the spots _vanish_ at some point then reappear your crystal wasn't centred. If it goes down and never comes back that was probably radiation damage.

![Spot finding](./COLSPOT.png)

### Indexing

The most useful indexing output is in the text, showing the fraction of spots indexed:

```console

 ***** INDEXING OF OBSERVED SPOTS IN SPACE GROUP #   1 *****
     22729 OUT OF     23157 SPOTS INDEXED.
        2 REJECTED REFLECTIONS (REASON: OVERLAP)
      426 REJECTED REFLECTIONS (REASON: TOO FAR FROM IDEAL POSITION)
 EXPECTED ERROR IN SPINDLE  POSITION     0.207 DEGREES
 EXPECTED ERROR IN DETECTOR POSITION      0.92 PIXELS
```

then how well the spot positions match between computed and observed spot positions:

```console
 ***** DIFFRACTION PARAMETERS USED AT START OF INTEGRATION *****

 REFINED VALUES OF DIFFRACTION PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM     22729 INDEXED SPOTS
 REFINED PARAMETERS:   AXIS BEAM ORIENTATION CELL

```

This is show in the GUI, which is a little easier, and shows choices for the lattice but by default it works in P1, and we can worry about the real symmetry later. The GUI also shows the number of spots which were indexed and unindexed as a function of frame number, which is probably the most useful graphical output:

![Indexing](./IDXREF.png)

### Integration

This is where we measure the strength of all the spots and get estimates of the uncertainties, as well as starting to get an idea of how the overall scale of the data changes - this should match with your expectations based on the geometry - a "blocky" crystal should have fairly uniform scales, a plate may have something completely different.

![Integration](./INTEGRATE.png)

### Scaling

Thinking back to DIALS: in XDS the scaling includes symmetry estimation, and this is the first time we can get a proper idea of the data quality as assessed by the merging statistics.

This has the following text output, which gives an idea of the resolution limit:

We can feed this back by adding:

```console
INCLUDE_RESOLUTION_RANGE=50 1.7
```

to `XDS.INP` then changing the `JOB=` line to `JOB=CORRECT` and rerunning, to give:
