# DIALS for CBMS Tutorial Series

This is a pair of tutorials for the CBMS Tutorial Series. The data are from Zenodo so you are able to download them and run this at home, and the software to do the tutorials is freely available. The two tutorials are to teach you to operate the software, first with one (or more) data sets from a single crystal then from a collection of 36 smaller data sets.

[Simple tutorial](./WORKFLOW.md) takes you through some of the basic steps.

[Simple, with NSLS II data](./NSLS.md)

[The more interesting](./COWS_PIGS_PEOPLE.md) tutorial takes you through some multi-crystal analysis.
