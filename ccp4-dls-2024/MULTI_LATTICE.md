# Multi Lattice Data Processing

The [simple workflow](./WORKFLOW.md) covered the bases for processing a simple data set, and shows the flow we would hope for for a well behaved data set. This isn't guaranteed however, and what looks like single crystals may not be...

![Image of an apparently single protein crystal](./images/protk-oav.png)

The crystals were reported to be fragile, which we will explore. I should upload these data to Zenodo to allow external folks to follow along...

## Start of Processing

The processing workflow starts in the same way as always: importing some data and some spot finding. For brevity we will import only the first 600 images so:

```
dials.import /dls/i04/data/2024/mx39148-1/TestProteinaseK/ProtK_2/ProtK_2_1_master.h5 image_range=1,600
```

This is an arbitrary choice to balance between the quality of the narrative and the time taken to perform the processing steps. Looking at the images with

```
dials.image_viewer imported.expt
```

gives

![Zoom of the centre of the diffraction](./images/protk-zoom-diff.png)

here I stacked 10 images and zoomed in on the centre: there is evidence here of multiple lattices, since there are overlapping lines of spots. We should be alert to the possibility of more than one crystal in the beam (no surprise, given the title of the tutorial.) We find spots following the usual procedure:

```
dials.find_spots imported.expt
```

which gives:

```
Calculated 108393 spot centroids
Calculated 108393 spot intensities
Filtered 107640 of 108393 spots by peak-centroid distance

Saved 107640 reflections to strong.refl
```

At this point we could look at the reciprocal lattice viewer where it will be obvious that there are multiple lattices, however let's proceed to indexing first and see what the results look like.

## Indexing

The usual procedure after spot finding is to index the data: in the previous tutorial this worked very well, indexing almost all of the reflections with a single model:

```
dials.index imported.expt strong.refl
```

After a short time we see:

```

i.e. we have a good model, but it only covers just over half of the reflections. This can be confirmed by looking at the reciprocal lattice view:

```
dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer indexed.expt indexed.refl
```

![Reciprocal lattice view](./images/protk-rlv.png)

Where I switched on the "show reciprocal cell" option and rotated the view to sepatate the lattices. We can now guess that there are probably two lattices, so rerun indexing with:

```
dials.index imported.expt strong.refl max_lattices=2
```

which will index the first lattice as before, then _exclude_ those spots and attempt to index the remaining reflections. Once the two lattices have been identified the reflections will be reassigned to each according to the closest one, and refined. The result is then the two models, a summary of the number of indexed reflections and the pairwise relationships between the lattices:

Saving refined experiments to indexed.expt
Saving refined reflections to indexed.refl
```

We have now indexed almost all the reflections, confirming that we have two lattices, and got good refinement results for each. Looking once more at the reciprocal lattices we see that they are quite well separated:

```
dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer indexed.expt indexed.refl
```

![Reciprocal lattice view of two lattices](./images/protk-rlv-2.png)

At this point you can also select "view in crystal frame" to see how the two lattices cover potentially different areas of reciprocal space. Viewing the output of

```
dials.report indexed.expt indexed.refl
```

Allows the number of reflections indexed on each lattice as a function of image number to be inspected - clearly both lattices are present throughout the data set.

## Continue Processing

At this point we have a model which consists of _two_ lattices for one data set, but otherwise we can proceed along the usual workflow so:

```
dials.refine indexed.expt indexed.refl
dials.integrate refined.expt refined.refl
```

This will take a little longer than processing a single lattice. After this we consider the impact of having two lattices on the data in terms of the overlapping of reflections - in this case we _probably_ got away with it largely:

```
dials.image_viewer integrated.expt integrated.refl
```

![Image zoomed on two modules of integrated data](./images/protk-image-overlaps.png)

We do however have some potentially overlapped reflections so some of the measurements will be affected.

Unlike the simple workflow example, and similarly to the [cows, pigs and people](./COWS_PIGS_PEOPLE.md), we need to use `dials.cosym` to solve the symmetry and resolve any indexing ambiguity, because we have two separate crystals here.

```
dials.cosym integrated.expt integrated.refl
```

Here we find that the symmetry is P4/mmm (i.e. P13212 or similar) and can proceed to scaling the data:

```
dials.scale symmetrized.expt symmetrized.refl
dials.merge scaled.expt scaled.refl
```

giving:
