# DIALS for Data Processing (CCP4 / APS 2024)

This is a pair of tutorials for the CCP4 workshop at GM/CA. The data are from Zenodo so you are able to download them and run this at home, and the software to do the tutorials is freely available. The two tutorials are to teach you to operate the software, first with one (or more) data sets from a single crystal then from a collection of 36 smaller data sets.

[Simple tutorial](./WORKFLOW.md) takes you through some of the basic steps.

[The more interesting](./COWS_PIGS_PEOPLE.md) tutorial takes you through some multi-crystal analysis.
