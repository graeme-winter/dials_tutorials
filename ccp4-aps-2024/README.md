# Processing üêÆüê∑üßë‚Äçü¶≥ with DIALS (CCP4 / APS 2024)

## Introduction

DIALS data processing may be run by automated tools such as `xia2` or interactively on the command line. For a tutorial it is more useful to use the latter, to explain the opportunities afforded by the software. In any data processing package the workflow requires reading data, finding spots, indexing to get an orientation matrix, refinement, integration and then scaling / correction: DIALS is no different.

This tutorial deviates slightly from the mainstream by _starting_ with data from a number of crystals, first from a single sample type and then from a mixture, which will show you how to classify data with subtle differences (e.g. presence or absence of a ligand.)

## The Data

[The data](https://zenodo.org/records/13890874) were taken on i24 at Diamond Light Source as part of routine commissioning work, with a number of data sets recorded from different crystals. Crystals were prepared of the protein insulin from cows, pigs and people (as described on the Zenodo deposition; bovine, porcine and human insulin, of course all grown in e-coli anyway).

All data have symmetry I213 and very similar unit cell constants so you can _try_ to merge them together and it will work, but won't give you good results as you will be measuring a mixture of structures. The data on the deposition are in `tar` archives so I am assuming you have already downloaded them all and unpacked them into `../data`: if you have done something different you will need to take a little care at the `dials.import` stage.

## The Workflow

The [workflow](../se-thaumatin/processing_in_detail.md) is the same with one data set as with many, with some small deviations - data from multiple crystals will not in general share an orientation matrix so the indexing will need to _not_ join all the lattices.

As mentioned above the flow is to read the data, find spots, index, refine, integrate and then derive some corrections from symmetry related reflections, which involves assigning the symmetry. In DIALS we use the following tools:

- `dials.import` - read all the image headers to make sense of the metadata
- `dials.find_spots` - find the spots - with DIALS we find spots across the whole data set and one spot across multiple images is "found" in 3D
- `dials.index` - assign indices to the spots and derive unit cell, symmetry
- `dials.refine` - improve the models from indexing (separate as allows "wobbles")
- `dials.integrate` - measure the background subtracted spot intensity
- `dials.symmetry` - derive the Patterson symmetry of the crystal from the data
- `dials.scale` - correct the data for sample decay, overall scale from beam or illuminated volume and absorption
- `dials.export` - output processed data for e.g. use in CCP4 or PHENIX

With multiple sweeps from a single crystal, we can assign a single orientation matrix and then use this throughout the processing (the default) - however if you have data from multiple crystals some of the assumptions will break down so we need to (i) tell the software that the crystals _do not_ share a matrix and in the symmetry determination also resolve any indexing ambiguity: we therefore replace `dials.symmetry` with `dials.cosym`.

## Import

The data are in `../data`: for the first pass through this tutorial we will just process the "cow" data `CIX...` to keep things simple. There are data from 12 crystals in here and if we simply import every frame, `dials.import` will make sense of what it finds:

```
dials.import ../data/CIX*gz
```

to get:

Writing experiments to imported.expt
```

This shows the filename patterns, how many images for each and the total it found - 12 sweeps each of 100 images. We can get much more detail on this with `dials.show` which can print the "DIALS understanding" of what the data look like. There are ways to streamline this for very large numbers of images, but for now this is fine.

At this point: scan the output - do you have what you expected? Many problems with DIALS processing can be solved here.

## Spot Finding

Spot finding is exactly what it sounds like: finding where all the spots are in the data sets. In DIALS spots in the same place on adjacent images are considered to be joined so the spot is a three dimensional object. You can explore the spot finding by opening the images in `dials.image_viewer` with

```
dials.image_viewer imported.expt
```

and then clicking through the options at the bottom of the control window (I will demo this in real life, and make a video, but you can click through the steps to "threshold" which is the set of pixels the spot fiding will pick out). The spot finding will give a summary of the number of signal pixels on every image, the number of found spots on each run and at the end a histogram of the distribution of spots across the images on each run, as:

```

Saved 80603 reflections to strong.refl
```

You can also look at the spot finding result in the image viewer with


```
dials.image_viewer imported.expt strong.refl
```

which should look like:

![Image with spots](./images/spots.png)

Now that we have found the spots we can start to consider some initial analysis - for example, looking at the distribution of the spots in reciprocal space. For a single scan we will see a single lattice, but in this case we will see the same 10¬∞ wedge many times, because right now we don't know anything about the reciprocal space orientation. You can pick out one lattice and rotate it, to see the actual reciprocal space orientations.

![Reciprocal view](./images/rlv0.png)

## Indexing and Refinement

If you played with the lattice viewer in the previous step you will have seen some nice lattices. The computational approach to finding them is to use `dials.index`: you pass the experiments and the spots and it will puzzle everything out. Here, we have multiple lattices so we need to tell the program that:

```
dials.index imported.expt strong.refl joint=false
```

This will go through and assign a lattice for each run. You can best look at what it has done by again using the reciprocal lattice viewer and this time passing the output:

```
dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer indexed.expt indexed.refl
```

If you select "show in crystal frame" you can see how the lattices _may_ align in reciprocal space - at this point we don't have a true understanding of the symmetry, only the unit cell, but already you can check for things like preferred orientation. With these data, the distribution looks like:

![Reciprocal view](./images/rlv1.png)

i.e. there is no evidence of preferential orientation. Obviously at this point we would hope that the data have a consistent unit cell - you can look at this by switching on the unit cell view in the reciprocal lattice viewer, or by running `dials.show` and checking the unit cells:

```
Ethics-Gradient tutorial :( $ dials.show indexed.expt | grep "Unit cell"

```

Here we can see they are all variations on a theme of 67√Ö / 109¬∞ x 3 - what I would expect for cubic insulin. If there are outliers you can re-run with the known cell as a prior, as

```
dials.index imported.expt strong.refl joint=false unit_cell=67,67,67,109,109,109
```

to give consistency: this is not necessary here.

After indexing, we can refine the models used to describe the data - this allows for e.g. variations in the unit cell parameters or small amounts of movement of the crystal with respect to the goniometer. The refinement will improve the alignment between where the spots are observed to be and where they are calculated to be from the current models, which ideally should be substantially under a pixel e.g.

in this case.

## Integration

Given a refined model, we need to now compute the locations of all the spots on the images and measure their intensities: this process has a few steps:

- calculation of the location of all the spots from the current model
- esimation of the spot dimensions modelled as Gaussians on the image and in rotation
- gathering of the spot to compute a reciprocal space "average" spot shape
- scaling this against the observed spots on the images

For education, these steps can be run somewhat independently (e.g. using `dials.create_profile_mdoel` and `dials.predict`) which can allow inspection of what the models are _before_ attempting integration, which can be useful for investigating problematic data sets. Viewing the results of integration can be reassuring, but is generally not necessary (use `dials.image_viewer integrated.expt integrated.refl`):

![Integrated images](./images/integ.png)

This step can be computationally challenging for substantial data sets but for this set it should be pretty quick.

## Symmetry Determination
