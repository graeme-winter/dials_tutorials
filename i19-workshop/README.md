# I19 Data Processing Workshop (Feb '23)

## Example data

Data recorded "back in the day" from Tetrabromobenzene (C6H2Br4) at 320k on i19-1. Crystal has symmetry P21/n and unit cell 4.08, 11.21, 9.84, 90 100.7, 90. Data in FIXME add directory, and consists of four runs of images following a standard strategy.

## Processing tutorials

There are two tutorials here - one using `xia2` and the other (much more interesting) one running through the individual steps using the `dials` command line tools.

[Boring one using `xia2`](./xia2/README.md) and [much more interesting using `dials`](./dials/README.md).
